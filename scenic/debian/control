Description: telepresence software for live performances and installations
 Scenic is a free software suite for streaming audio, video and MIDI
 between live events. It was created at the Society for Arts and
 Technology (SAT) to give artists a powerful tool for telepresence
 in live arts contexts and new media installations.
 .
 The streaming is done over RTP with the GStreamer multimedia
 framework.  Users can choose either low-bandwidth or high-quality
 codecs, depending on what is available on their system. It offers
 up to as many audio channels as your audio device supports.
 .
 This package contains the Scenic desktop application.
 .
 For MIDI streaming support, one should install either the python-pygame
 package with version greater than or equal to 1.9.1release, or the
 python-portmidi package. If none of them is installed, all the widgets
 in the MIDI tab of the Scenic application will be disabled, and the
 midistream utility will not work at all.
