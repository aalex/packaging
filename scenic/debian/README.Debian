For MIDI streaming support, one should install either the python-pygame
package with version greater than or equal to 1.9.1release, or the 
python-portmidi package. If none of them is installed, all the widgets 
in the MIDI tab of the Scenic application will be disabled, and the 
midistream utility will not work at all.
